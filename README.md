## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Setting Goals
```python
# User input examples that trigger goal analysis:
"I want to lose 5kg in 2 months"
"I need to gain 10 pounds in 3 weeks"
"I want to build muscle and strength"
"I want to run 5km without stopping"
```

### Meal Planning
```python
# Dietary preferences that trigger meal planning:
"I'm vegetarian and need a meal plan"
"I follow a vegan diet"
"I need diabetic-friendly meals"
"I have food allergies to nuts"
```

### Workout Recommendations
```python
# Experience levels for workout planning:
"I'm a complete beginner to exercise"
"I have some experience with weight training"
"I'm an advanced athlete looking for a challenge"
```

### Progress Tracking
```python
# Progress updates:
"I completed my workout today!"
"I lost 2kg this week"
"I ate healthy meals for 5 days straight"
"I'm feeling stronger and more energetic"
```

### Handoff Triggers
```python
# Escalation triggers:
"I want to speak to a human trainer"
"Can I talk to a real coach?"

# Nutrition expert triggers:
"I have diabetes and need special diet advice"
"I have severe food allergies"

# Injury support triggers:
"I have knee pain and need safe exercises"
"I'm recovering from a back injury"
```

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Streaming Implementation
The agent uses `Runner.stream()` for real-time responses:

```python
async for step in Runner.stream(
    starting_agent=agent,
    input=user_input,
    context=context,
    hooks=hooks
):
    print(step.pretty_output)
```

### Guardrail Implementation
Input validation ensures proper goal format:

```python
class GoalInputGuardrail(InputGuardrail):
    def validate(self, input_data: str) -> bool:
        patterns = [
            r'(lose|gain)\s+\d+\s*(kg|pounds|lbs)\s+in\s+\d+\s*(weeks|months|days)',
            r'(build|increase)\s+(muscle|strength|endurance)',
            # ... more patterns
        ]
        return any(re.search(pattern, input_data.lower()) for pattern in patterns)
```

### Async Tool Implementation
Meal planning demonstrates async functionality:

```python
class MealPlannerTool(Tool):
    async def run_async(self, dietary_preferences: str, context: RunContextWrapper[UserSessionContext]) -> dict:
        await asyncio.sleep(0.5)  # Simulate API call
        meal_plan = self._generate_meal_plan(dietary_preferences, context.data.goal)
        context.data.meal_plan = meal_plan["meals"]
        return meal_plan
```

# After goal setting
UserSessionContext(
    name="Alex",
    uid=12345,
    goal={"goal_type": "weight_loss", "target_value": "5kg", "timeframe": "2 months"}
)

# After meal planning
UserSessionContext(
    # ... previous data
    diet_preferences="vegetarian",
    meal_plan=[...7-day meal plan...]
)

# After handoff
UserSessionContext(
    # ... previous data
    injury_notes="knee pain",
    handoff_logs=["Transferred to injury support at 2024-01-15T10:30:00"]
)
```
